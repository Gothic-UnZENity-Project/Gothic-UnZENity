If you want to use SpeechToText feature, then place your local LLM here.
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/unity/inference-engine-whisper-tiny/tree/main
2. Download:
  1. data/vocab.json
  2. model/decoder_model.onnx
  3. model/decoder_with_past_model.onnx
  4. model/encoder_model.onnx
  5. model/logmel_spectogram.onnx
3. Place it in here and the feature is activated at runtime

HINT: If you do not! want GenAI features, ignore the steps above. If you don't place the local LLM on your system, it is deactivated and can't be used.

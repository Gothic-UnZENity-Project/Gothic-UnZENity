## Disable SpeechToText:
-> If you do not! want GenAI features, ignore the steps below. If you don't place the local LLM on your system, it is deactivated and can't be used.


## Enable SpeechToText:

-> For latest instructions to activate it in game, please check the UnZENity wiki at: https://github.com/Gothic-UnZENity-Project/Gothic-UnZENity/wiki

In general:
1. Go to UnZENity release page and select the one with .sentis files stored: https://github.com/Gothic-UnZENity-Project/Gothic-UnZENity/releases
2. Download:
  1. vocab.json
  2. decoder_model.sentis
  3. decoder_with_past_model.sentis
  4. encoder_model.sentis
  5. logmel_spectogram.sentis
3. Place it in here


WARNING:
There are two known pitfalls:
1. SpeechToText is transformed on GPU. (e.g.) Quest2 is known to cause stutter when recording voice and transforming your input. It's best experienced with PCVR due to the dedicated GPU.
2. Unity's Microphone API can cause some delays when recording starts or ends. This is unrelated to GPU/CPU limitations and may vary based on device and Microphone driver.

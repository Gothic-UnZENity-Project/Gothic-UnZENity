# Contributing to Gothic-UnZENity
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

For gamers:
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features

For developers:
- Submitting a fix
- Becoming a maintainer

## For gamers
We currently have no Discord server, therefore feel free to reach out to #JaXt0r on Discord for questions.

## For developers
We're mainly building Gothic-UnZENity by leveraging C# classes and build core Unity magic.
Less 2D/3D designs are needed (as we load _everything_ from original assets at runtime).
To all coders and VR developers: Welcome, you're at the right spot.

### We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We welcome your pull requests:

1. Try to align with current status of the project and team member's work (Discord).
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
3. Issue your pull request with extensive information about what changed and how to test it.

### Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/Gothic-UnZENity-Project/Gothic-UnZENity/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Gothic-UnZENity-Project/Gothic-UnZENity/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

(People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.)

### Use a Consistent Coding Style
To assist consistent development styles, we:
1. set up an .editorconfig file which is automatically used by Rider and VS22+
2. wrote an exhaustive example at our docs: [Style-Guide.md](./Docs/development/style-guide.md)

### License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GPL-3.0 License.

### Becoming a maintainer
> You'll find our current feature development status at the [Projects](https://github.com/Gothic-UnZENity-Project/Gothic-UnZENity/projects?query=is%3Aopen) page.

If you want to build Gothic-UnZENity together, then you're encouraged to join our active developer base. Feel free to grab a ticket you'd like to drive and reach out to #JaXt0r on Discord for further questions.
